# MEAN-SEO
SEO Solution for MEAN.JS applications which forwards crawlers requests to a compiled HTML copy using PhantomJS.

## Longer Version
If you ever tried to make your AngularJS application crawler friendly, you already know this is a bit of a headache. Part of evolving the MEAN.JS stack towards production ready state, the MEAN-SEO module makes it pretty simple to make sure your MEAN application is ready for crawlers requests.

When a crawler requests the page using the [**\_escaped\_fragment\_**](https://developers.google.com/webmasters/ajax-crawling/docs/specification), the module launches the PhantomJS headless-browser, which creates a copy of the page and stores it in cache for future requests. 

## Quick Install
First you'll need to install the MEAN-SEO module using npm:

	npm install mean-seo --save

Then include in you express application: 

	var seo = require('mean-seo');

And finally, just before you require the **app.router** middleware add the following:
	
	app.use(seo({
		cacheClient: 'disk', // Can be 'disk' or 'redis'
    	redisURL: 'redis://:password@hostname:port', // If using redis, optionally specify server credentials
		cacheDuration: 2 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 1000, // In milliseconds for disk cache
		cacheBuffer: 200 * 1024 // The the largest amount of data allowed on stdout, used for PhantomJS. Increase this when receiving 'stdout maxBuffer exceeded' errors.
	}));
	
	// app.use(app.router) will be below this line 

If you use HTML5 URL scheme then you should let the crawler know you're serving an AJAX application by adding the following to the HEAD tag of your page:

	<meta name=”fragment” content=”!”>
